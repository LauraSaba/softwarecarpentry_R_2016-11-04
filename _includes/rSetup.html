  <h3>R</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> is a programming language
    that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and
    statistical analysis. To interact with R, we use
    <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>. Make sure you have a recent
    version of R (3.2.2 or higher).

	from <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/index.html">CRAN</a>.

	Install R by downloading and running

	from <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/index.html">CRAN</a>. If you
	have Snow Leopard, you might run into issues when trying to download the
	datasets directly from R using the `download.file()` function. If it's
	the case, you will need to download the data files manually. Don't
	hesitate to ask the instructor for help if you run into issues.

	You can download the binary files for your distribution
	from <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/index.html">CRAN</a>. Or
	you can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu
	run <code>sudo apt-get install r-base</code> and for Fedora run
        <code>sudo yum install R</code>).  This workshop requires a version of R
        no older than version 3.2.2; the default software repositories for some
        Linux distributions maybe out of date. It is recommended that you use a
        more recent version of R by adding the relevant entries to your package
        manager. See the instructions for
        your <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/">distribution</a> on
        the CRAN website. Also, please install the
	<a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop">RStudio IDE</a>.
